# Retail Sales Insights | SQL (With RFM Analysis)

# üè™ Retail Sales Insights ‚Äî SQL Project (With RFM Analysis)

## üìñ Overview
This project demonstrates **end-to-end SQL data analysis** on a fictional retail store dataset.  
It covers every stage of the data analytics lifecycle ‚Äî from **data validation** and **cleaning** to **exploratory analysis** and **advanced customer segmentation (RFM)**.  

The goal is to uncover actionable business insights such as:
- Who are the most valuable and frequent customers?  
- Which products and categories drive the most revenue?  
- When is the best time to launch marketing campaigns?  
- How can RFM segmentation help identify customer loyalty and retention opportunities?



# Project Overview

_ _At first glance, the data looked messy ‚Äî inconsistent category names, missing values represented as \N, and even some potential duplicates. So before doing any complex analysis, I focused on one thing: getting the data right.__

1. Data Validation:Ensured that all records have been implemented and data integrity is intact.
2. Data Staging:Created staging tables for safe data cleaning and transformation.
3. Data Cleaning & Missing Values:Handle missing values and standardize inconsistent entries.
4. Duplicate Handling:Removed that duplicate transactions while maintaining a clean dataset.
5. Final Data Standardization:Ensured that consistent and accurate categorical data.
6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):Analysis to understand when,how,where,which product to launch to  marketing campaign on.
7. Advanced Analysis: RFM Segmentation
8. Summary of Insights will be shown below

# Tools & Techniques
* MySQL 
* Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, COUNT, SUM)**
